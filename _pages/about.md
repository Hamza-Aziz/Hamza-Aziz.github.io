## Work Experience 👨‍💻

### DevOps Engineer SQLI Dortmund, Germany (remotely) 
📅 <time> Aug 2021 – Present </time>
- I have created and currently administer five on-premises pre-production and production Kubernetes clusters. Additionally, I implemented a GitOps strategy using Flux CD.
- Orchestrated the development and implementation of CI/CD pipelines using Github Actions, resulting in a 40% reduction in deployment time and a 25% increase in deployment frequency.
- Setup and maintenance of comprehensive monitoring solutions, Prometheus, Loki, Promtail, OpenTelemetry, Tempo, and Grafana. 
- Containerization and packaging of applications using Docker and Helm.
- Maintaining constant 99.99% uptime for SAP commerce applications within both Azure and AWS (more than 40 servers).
- Introduced the use of Terraform for resource management. Created extensive modules for EC2 autoscaling, RDS resources, ALB,CloudWatch Alarms, VPC, and ECS resources.
- Took ownership of increasing visibility across all cloud resources by integrating Datadog with Terraform for metrics monitoring and logs. This initiative increased response time to issues within our cloud environments and helped us reduce tech debt by enabling us to identify the root cause of several alert conditions.
- I regularly train team members on how to make the most of Terraform and Datadog in their workflows. I am also part of the hiring committee for new interns and conduct technical interviews.
- Optimized the performance of the EC2 MySQL database master-worker replication and decreased replication errors by more than 30% through performance-tuning and management.
- Implemented HAProxy to manage high traffic spikes and service request routing, which greatly improved the response time of our web applications.
- I am the main point of contact for our Jenkins and GitLab CI CICD pipelines. I ensure the prevention of exposed secrets and introduced container/vulnerability scanning measures. I optimized build times significantly through build-cache management and integrated CICD alerts with Microsoft Teams.
- I continue to automate manual tasks using a variety of Python, Bash, and Ansible scripts. Some examples include a Python Lambda to stop dev machines that have been idle for a period of time or outside business hours and automation for MySQL backups.
- I created a self-service platform for developers using the Serverless Framework and GitHub Actions which allows developers to deploy their own lambdas with defined configurations and auxiliary resources, resulting in multiple daily deployments.
- I regularly advocate for the team to produce and maintain documentation. Furthermore, I have taken the initiative to produce visual diagrams and flowcharts for all of our applications and processes using Draw.io and Confluence.
